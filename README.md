# Programming-Endeavours
Things I get up to in programming.

Most of this stuff is just from me learning C++ and C, converting projects between the two and just messing around in general. If you want to compile these, use GCC for anything in the C folder and G++ for anything in the C++ folder.

To compile one of these files on Linux do the following:

If you haven't already installed them:

Debian:
$ sudo apt install gcc g++
Arch:
$ pacman -S gcc g++
Fedora:
$ sudo dnf install gcc g++

Compile a C file:
$ gcc (filename).c -o (outputname)
Compile a C++ file:
$ g++ (filename).cpp -o (outputname)

Run the file:
$ ./(outputname)
